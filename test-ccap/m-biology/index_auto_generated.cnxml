<title>These are "split" elements with special classes from previously existing "hybrid" art-connections feature</title>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
1- Use existing .art-connections for eoc generation && eob solutions
   

2- Set feature back to generic note and add .art class 
   a- extracted figures/caption from previous art-connections exercise
   b- extracted .art-connections <problem> and wrapped in <para>

				<media id="fig-ch04-03-01b" alt="Part b: This illustration depicts a typical eukaryotic plant cell. The nucleus of a plant cell contains chromatin and a nucleolus, the same as an animal cell. Other structures that the plant cell has in common with the animal cell include rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, peroxisomes, and ribosomes. The fluid inside the plant cell is called the cytoplasm, just as it is in an animal cell. The plant cell has three of the four cytoskeletal components found in animal cells: microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments. Plant cells do not have centrosomes. Plant cells have four structures not found in animals cells: chloroplasts, plastids, a central vacuole, and a cell wall. Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis; they have an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and stack of membranes inside the inner membrane. The central vacuole is a very large, fluid-filled structure that maintains pressure against the cell wall. Plastids store pigments. The cell wall is outside the cell membrane.">

			<caption>(a) These figures show the major organelles and other cell components of (a) a typical animal cell and (b) a typical eukaryotic plant cell. The plant cell has a cell wall, chloroplasts, plastids, and a central vacuole—structures not found in animal cells. Plant cells do not have lysosomes or centrosomes.</caption>

		<caption>Notice that as a cell increases in size, its surface area-to-volume ratio decreases. When there is insufficient surface area to support a c
		ell’s increasing volume, a cell will either divide or die. The cell on the left has a volume of 1 mm<sup>3</sup> and a surface area of 6 mm<sup>2</sup>, 
		with a surface area-to-volume ratio of 6 to 1, whereas the cell on the right has a volume of 8 mm<sup>3</sup> and a surface area of 24 mm<sup>2</sup>, 
		with a surface area-to-volume ratio of 3 to 1.
