 * Make author/title page
 * Remove duplicate glossary items
 * Scale images (using Python Imaging Library to get their size)
 * Add footnotes for links (make sure mp3 links in Music Theory work)
 * Fix the baseline shift of math (it's a little off)
 * Allow multiple images in a figure
 * Convert collxml automatically


For Regression:
 * Run PDF gen on all modules, logging which fail.
